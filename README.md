# Implememnting-a-Secure-ACR-and-Azure-Kubernetes-Service
This project focuses on advanced configuration and security hardening of Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to ensure a robust containerized environment. Key objectives include implementing secure access controls, enabling image scanning and vulnerability assessments in ACR, and configuring network policies, role-based access controls, and workload identity management within AKS. Additionally, the project applies best practices for securing communication between ACR and AKS, with a focus on minimizing attack surfaces, enforcing compliance policies, and enhancing overall threat detection and response capabilities in container orchestration.
